Wide World Importers (WWI) is a wholesale novelty goods importer and distributor operating from the San Francisco bay area. Currently they have SQL Server based on premise data warehouse solution. They are working on modernizing the solution in the cloud. They reached out to FastTrack for Azure team to help implement a modern data housing solution/POC in Azure, leveraging Azure Synapse, Azure ML for Machine Learning, Azure Databricks and Power BI.

WWI would like to leverage one platform to achieve both their real time and batch analytics goals as part of there innovation and modernization efforts. They believe Azure Synapse Analytics can help them achieve that goal, implementing the solution through Lambda Architecture, a modern big data analytics patterns.

With Azure Synapse platform Serverless SQL Pools, WWI can migrate their existing DW solution with few changes as well as get more frequent updates to their data for reporting  and analytics without the overhead of loading to Dedicated Pools. This will save costs while they further evaluate if, how and when the solution should be moved to a dedicated SQL Pool. Data processing for ML use cases, since they have a lots of realtime data, they wanted a scalable solution, where they can respond to the data growth needs without worrying about cost, whey they do not have any processing needed.
